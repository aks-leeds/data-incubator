# Data Readme
This README explains all about the data for The Data Incubator semi-final challenge. 
In this project, I will be working with social media data from The Recording Academy. The Recording Academy is the organization that gives The GRAMMY Awards.

## Overview of the data file structure
The data sets include four years (2014 to 2017) of metrics from The GRAMMYsâ€™ posts on Facebook and Twitter.

### Twitter Files:
4 files, 
Only two metrics (Favorites, Retweets), 
Paring down rows and columns, 

### Facebook Files:
8 post-level files.
1 page-level (not essential, more for reference),
Many metrics, many sheets,
Paring down rows and columns
