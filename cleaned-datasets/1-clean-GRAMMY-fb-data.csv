I asked if he would let me hang onto it for him. Perhaps permanently? He agreed. When he shipped it out I was so thrilled. There were so many classics from my childhood I had forgotten about and also an incredible assortment of classics I had not forgotten about, but was overjoyed to rediscover on vinyl. Pictured here I am holding Disintegration by The Cure. This was the first LP I bought for myself at the start of my own personal collection. I don’t keep the two collections separate. When I buy a new piece of vinyl I just slip it in between a Yes record and a weird random soundtrack from the 80’s and that feels right to me.” - Tegan Quin of Tegan and Sara  https://www.instagram.com/p/BJN9I3fjNi0/",Photo,8/17/2016 10:40,378279,548255,5078,141

In the song ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"", I love how she talks about about women's and men's struggles and reminds us to not allow ""that thing"" to take over our lives. I interpreted ""that thing"" to be materialistic things and sex. She reminded girls of their self worth. Her lyric, 'why be a hard rock when you really are a gem,' really spoke to me. ""Zion"" was another song that hit me hard. It made me feel something that not many records can make me feel. I love her honesty and her fearlessness. That's what makes this album so special to me.
